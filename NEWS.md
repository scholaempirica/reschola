# reschola 0.3.3 (Safe the Fonts)

<!-- TODO -----------------------------------------------------
- PDF template: incorporate changes from IvP and EZ, especially citations and so on
- amend R CMD warnings
-->

## Breaking changes

- `redoc` reversible Word format is now completely removed from the package; from now on, use `schola_pdf()` primarily (`schola_word()` is still available)

## Changes

- PDF template now handles footnotes better
- `czech_date_interval()` now raises an error when you try to supply more than one entry
- `ls_call()` gives an error when you try to provide another `sSessionKey` in `params`
- `ls_call()` passes `error` message to the user when there is one
- `ls_call()` replaces `NULL`s with `NA`s (thus more API responses can be turned into a tibble)
- `ls_call()` messaging is less disruptive
- the documentation is more verbose on some topics
- fonts registration is now more verbose and `import_fonts()` checks that everything went well; solutions are provided otherwise

## New features

- `ls_responses()` (and thus `ls_export()`) strips out the `tibble`-wide `variable.labels` attribute and spreads it among the individual variables, which enables you to modify the `tibble` without messing the labels positions and/or producing length incompatibilities
- `ls_export()` gains new argument `clean_labels` which by default cleans up repeating parts of labels of subquestions (i.e., those outside square brackets)
- new function `ls_set_participant_properties()` enabling you to set or edit participant table
- new function `copy_schola_template()` which copies the template (`pdf` by default) into the active project directory

## Bug fixes

- `czech_date_interval()` now correctly suppresses redundant information
- you are now informed about a solution when font registration fails, this concerns a bug in recent version of `Rttf2pt1` utility that the process rely on

# reschola 0.3.2 (Limy Schola)

## Changes

- default LimeSurvey API endpoint protocol changed to HTTPS

# reschola 0.3.1 (Limy Schola)

A tiny patch release resolving the issues with and simplifying the font installation process.

## Documentation
- fonts installation described in more detail, warning NOTE added

## Changes
- font installation is now carried out by a single function `import_fonts()`
- all fonts needed for the package functionality now comes in `reschola` and are not resourced from `hrbrthemes` anymore
- `import_fonts()` is now more verbose on the instruction
- `reschola` font directory is now opened automatically
- some namespace-prepended function calls replaced with proper `importFrom` declarations 

# reschola 0.3.0 (Limy Schola)

## Breaking changes

- automatically generated build script `build.R` is renamed to `build_all.R`, to allow multiple build scripts (pro tip: use [{buildr}](https://CRAN.r-project.org/web/packages/buildr/) package)

## New features

- new R Markdown document format `schola_pdf()`:
    - powered by custom LaTeX template and `report` class
    - uses Roboto font
    - reasonable defaults are used so the YAML header is not cluttered with stuff
    - figures are in PDF (via `cairo` device so non-ASCII characters are well supported) and are cropped automatically (new function `ensure_cropping()` that checks for dependencies needed for proper format functioning, providing help when an issue is discovered)
    - takes care of non-breakable spaces in Czech (especially before singlecharacter prepositions) via pre-release `pandoc` Lua filter (only repo fork currently, thanks [Delanii](https://github.com/Delanii/lua-filters))
    - handy `author` Pandoc variable (used in YAML header), which takes the language `lang` and automatically typesets the "and" or "a" separator before the last author (when there is only one, no separators are introduced whatsoever)


- `reschola` is now armed with its own LimeSurvey API interface, providing several functions tailored to our needs:
    - `ls_call()` implements general and fully customisable call to the API (you must adhere to [the documentation](https://api.limesurvey.org/classes/remotecontrol_handle.html))
    - `ls_export()` is going to be used most of the time, as it fetches both participants and their responses, it basically merges outputs from  `ls_participants()`, and `ls_responses()`
    - `ls_login()` is used for manual session key request; **it may be never used directly**, as every `ls_` call ensures the key is cached and not expired (key is stale after 2 hrs)
    - `ls_add_participants()` inserts one or more participants to the LimeSurvey database
    - `ls_invite()` sends an email invitation prepared in LimeSurvey web interface to the selected participants
    - `ls_get_attrs()` for retrieval of the custom survey attributes and their "semantic" form (i.e. human-readable description)
    
    
- new class `czech_date` with S3 method that prints the date in long format and with grammatically correct case, more in `as_czech_date()`
- new function `czech_date_interval()` that takes two dates and returns nicely formatted Czech date interval
    - czech date interval tries to print using non-breakable *en dash* when `pandoc` outputs to `LaTeX` (i.e., `schola_pdf()` format is used)
- new function `compile_and_open()` provides safe and comfortable way to render/compile `.Rmd` documents
- vector graphics logo of SCHOLA EMPIRICA in `.pdf` added
- development feature: *spellcheck on package introduced via `usethis`*

## Changes

- `99_reproducibility.Rmd` now uses base R `sessionInfo()`, not `sessioninfo` package, which seems like an unnecessary dependency

## Bug fixes

- organization name change to correct form
- `ggplot2::ScaleContinuousPosition` correctly imported, but still WIP
- `ls_participants()` handles attributes correctly when used as a character vector
